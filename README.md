Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have been widely used in
military and civilian areas. The positioning and return-to-home
tasks of UAVs deliberately depend on Global Positioning Systems
(GPS). However, the civilian GPS signals are not encrypted,
which can motivate numerous cyber-attacks on UAVs, including
Global Positioning System spoofing attacks. In these spoofing
attacks, a malicious user transmits counterfeit GPS signals. Numerous studies have proposed techniques to detect these attacks.
However, these techniques have some limitations, including low
probability of detection, high probability of misdetection, and
high probability of false alarm. In this paper, we investigate
and compare the performances of three ensemble-based machine
learning techniques, namely bagging, stacking, and boosting, in
detecting GPS attacks. The evaluation metrics are the accuracy,
probability of detection, probability of misdetection, probability
of false alarm, memory size, processing time, and prediction time
per sample. The results show that the stacking model has the
best performance compared to the two other ensemble models
in terms of all the considered evaluation metrics.
